# Judo Competition Manager


A Project to create a usable Judo Competition System. Primarly focused on 5 people Competition Groups.
I've done the competition managment my first time with excel sheets and think I can do better ;)

## Ideas behind
### Fighter
A fighter is a person participating in the competition. It will be created and needs already a Group. If you just want to create fighters, the group 0 is allowed too.

### Groups
The groups are meant to be a printable representation of fights and fighters.
